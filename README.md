# neat-rnn
This is a precise to-read list for recurrent neural network (RNN). 

Omit the long author lists; start with year, followed by title, jounral, and links. Newer papers go first. There are additional resources such as libraries, etc.

# Contributions
This repository originally is decided for to keep track of what I come across about recurrent neural network. But, I guess I will get more benifit (as well as you) if I publicize it . I hope everyone can contribue to it and make it better! So, please submit pull requests! For any questions, contact me (johnny5550822@g.ucla.edu)

# Additional resources
This repository is created in order to follow my choice of neatness and interest. There is another repository that also provide excellent (with full author lists, etc) sources for recurrent neural network, please visit [awesome-rnn] (https://github.com/kjw0612/awesome-rnn).
